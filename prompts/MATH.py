Question: The points $P,$ $Q,$ and $R$ are represented by the complex numbers $z,$ $(1 + i) z,$ and $2 \\overline{{z}},$ respectively, where $|z| = 1.$ When $P,$ $Q,$ and $R$ are not collinear, let $S$ be the fourth vertex of the parallelogram $PQSR.$ What is the maximum distance between $S$ and the origin of the complex plane?
Answer:
step 1: From the parallelogram condition: $S = Q + R - P$. Substitute $P=z$, $Q=(1+i)z$, $R=2\\overline{{z}}$ to get $S: w = iz + 2\\overline{{z}}$.
step 2: Compute $|w|^2 = w\\overline{{w}}$. After simplification with $|z|=1$, we find $|w|^2 = 5 - 8xy$, where $z=x+yi$.
step 3: Using $(x+y)^2\\ge0$, we have $-8xy\\le4$, so $|w|^2\\le9$, thus $|w|\\le3$. Equality can occur, so the maximum distance is 3.
so the final answer is: \\boxed{{3}}.  End of answer.

Question: Given a cylinder of fixed volume $V,$ the total surface area (including the two circular ends) is minimized for a radius of $R$ and height $H.$ Find $\\frac{{H}}{{R}}.$
Answer:
step 1: Let the radius be $r$ and height be $h$. The volume constraint is $\\pi r^2 h = V$.
step 2: The total surface area is $A = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r h$. Using AM-GM on $2\\pi r^2$, $\\pi r h$, and $\\pi r h$: $A = 2\\pi r^2 + \\pi r h + \\pi r h \\geq 3\\sqrt[3]{{(2\\pi r^2)(\\pi r h)(\\pi r h)}}$.
step 3: Since $\\pi r^2 h=V$, we have $r^2h=V/\\pi$. After simplification, the equality condition gives $2\\pi r^2=\\pi r h$, implying $h=2r$.
so the final answer is: \\boxed{{2}}.  End of answer.

Question: Suppose that $(u_n)$ is a sequence of real numbers satisfying $u_{{n+2}}=2u_{{n+1}}+u_n$ and that $u_3=9$ and $u_6=128$. What is $u_5$?
Answer:
step 1: Let $u_4 = a$. From the recurrence, $u_5 = 2u_4 + u_3 = 2a + 9$.
step 2: Also, $u_6 = 2u_5 + u_4 = 2(2a + 9) + a = 5a + 18$.
step 3: Given $u_6 = 128$, we have $5a +18 =128$. Thus $5a=110$ and $a=22$.
step 4: With $a=22$, $u_5 = 2(22)+9 = 44 + 9 = 53$.
so the final answer is: \\boxed{{53}}.  End of answer.

Question: The points $P,$ $Q,$ and $R$ are represented by the complex numbers $z,$ $(1 + i) z,$ and $2 \\overline{{z}},$ respectively, where $|z| = 1.$ When $P,$ $Q,$ and $R$ are not collinear, let $S$ be the fourth vertex of the parallelogram $PQSR.$ What is the maximum distance between $S$ and the origin of the complex plane?
Answer:
step 1: From the parallelogram condition: $S = Q + R - P$. Substitute $P=z$, $Q=(1+i)z$, $R=2\\overline{{z}}$ to get $S: w = iz + 2\\overline{{z}}$.
Reflection: The equation $w = iz + 2\\overline{{z}}$ appears correct based on the parallelogram rule, no issues here. 
step 2: Compute $|w|^2 = w\\overline{{w}}$. After simplification with $|z|=1$, we find $|w|^2 = 5 - 8xy$, where $z=x+yi$.
Reflection: **Error:** We should have expanded the expression $w = iz + 2\overline{{z}}$ properly, and the simplification in step 2 was prematurely made. Letâ€™s correct this.
step 3: Let $z = x + iy$, so $w = i(x + iy) + 2(x - iy)$. Expanding this, we get $w = -y + ix + 2x - 2iy = (2x - y) + i(x - 2y)$. Now we compute $|w|^2$:
\[
|w|^2 = (2x - y)^2 + (x - 2y)^2 = 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 + x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2
\]
Reflection: After redoing the calculation and simplifying correctly, we obtain $|w|^2 = 5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2$. This is a better simplification that matches the form we needed. Initially, I was too quick to simplify, but after correcting the steps, we now have a reliable form for $|w|^2$.
step 4: Using $(x+y)^2\\ge0$, we have $-8xy\\le4$, so $|w|^2\\le9$, thus $|w|\\le3$. Equality can occur, so the maximum distance is 3.
Reflection: This step is still valid after the correction. The final distance calculation remains the same, with $|w|$ being bounded by 3.

so the final answer is: \\boxed{{3}}.  End of answer.

Question: Given a cylinder of fixed volume $V,$ the total surface area (including the two circular ends) is minimized for a radius of $R$ and height $H.$ Find $\\frac{{H}}{{R}}.$
Answer:
step 1: Let the radius be $r$ and height be $h$. The volume constraint is $\\pi r^2 h = V$.
Reflection: This is a correct setup for the volume constraint.
step 2: The total surface area is $A = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r h$. Using AM-GM on $2\\pi r^2$, $\\pi r h$, and $\\pi r h$: $A = 2\\pi r^2 + \\pi r h + \\pi r h \\geq 3\\sqrt[3]{{(2\\pi r^2)(\\pi r h)(\\pi r h)}}$.
Reflection: This is where the error occurs. The AM-GM inequality application here is unnecessary and overly complicated for minimizing the surface area. The correct approach is to differentiate the surface area function directly.
step 3: Since $\\pi r^2 h=V$, we have $r^2h=V/\\pi$. After simplification, the equality condition gives $2\\pi r^2=\\pi r h$, implying $h=2r$.
Reflection: This step is correct, as it derives the relationship between $h$ and $r$ from the first principles of optimization.
so the final answer is: \\boxed{{2}}.  End of answer.

Question: Suppose that $(u_n)$ is a sequence of real numbers satisfying $u_{{n+2}}=2u_{{n+1}}+u_n$ and that $u_3=9$ and $u_6=128$. What is $u_5$?
Answer:
step 1: Let $u_4 = a$. From the recurrence, $u_5 = 2u_4 + u_3 = 2a + 9$.
Reflection: The recurrence relation is applied correctly, and the formula for $u_5$ is accurate.
step 2: Also, $u_6 = 2u_5 + u_4 = 2(2a + 9) + a = 5a + 18$.
Reflection: The formula for $u_6$ is correctly derived, but I will now check for consistency.
step 3: Given $u_6 = 128$, we have $5a +18 =128$. Thus $5a=110$ and $a=22$.
Reflection: The algebra here is correct, and solving for $a$ gives $a = 22$.
step 4: With $a=22$, $u_5 = 2(22)+9 = 44 + 9 = 53$.
Reflection: The calculation for $u_5$ is correct, and the value matches the recurrence relation.
so the final answer is: \\boxed{{53}}.  End of answer.

Question: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet? 
Thought Process:  Step 1, in the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $50. Step 2, betty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $30. This means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 - 15 = $5 more. Step 3, so the final answer is: 5. 
Evaluation Process:
Relevance of Sub-Questions: Sub-question 1: How much money does Betty currently have? Relevance: Directly relevant, as it helps determine her current savings.Sub-question 2: How much did her parents and grandparents give her? Relevance: Directly relevant, as this affects the total amount she has. Sub-question 3: How much more money does Betty need to reach $100? Relevance: This is essential for answering the original question.
Effectiveness of Decomposition: The sub-questions effectively break down the original question into logical parts. However, there is a calculation error in the final step. Betty's total after receiving the gifts should be calculated as follows: $50 (her savings) + $15 (from parents) + $30 (from grandparents) = $95. Therefore, she needs $100 - $95 = $5 more.
